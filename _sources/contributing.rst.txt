Contributing guidelines
=======================

Pull request checklist
----------------------

Before sending a pull request, be sure to follow this list.

-  Read the `contributing guidelines <CONTRIBUTING.md>`__
-  Read the `code of conduct <CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`__
-  Check if your changes comply with the `style
   guide <https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md>`__

How to become a contributor and submit your own code
----------------------------------------------------

We'd love to accept your changes, suggestions and patches! Be sure that
your changes, source code, and other ideas/implementations do not cause
intellectual property issues.

Contributing code
-----------------

If you have any improvements or new functionality that is interesting
for UrbanPy, send us your pull requests! If you are new to pull
requests, see Github's `how to
guide <https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests>`__.

UrbanPy team members will be assigned to review your pull requests. Once
the pull requests are approved and pass continuous integration checks, a
UrbanPy team member will apply ready to pull label to your change. This
means we are working on getting your pull request submitted to our
internal repository. After the change has been submitted internally,
your pull request will be merged automatically on GitHub.

Contribution guidelines and standards
-------------------------------------

Before sending your pull request for review, make sure your changes are
consistent with the guidelines and follow the Google coding style.

General guidelines and philosophy for contribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Include unit tests when you contribute new features, as they help to
   a) prove that your code works correctly, and b) guard against future
   breaking changes to lower the maintenance cost.
-  Bug fixes also generally require unit tests, because the presence of
   bugs usually indicates insufficient test coverage.
-  When you contribute a new feature to UrbanPy, the maintenance burden
   is (by default) transferred to the UrbanPy team. This means that the
   benefit of the contribution must be compared against the cost of
   maintaining the feature.
-  Full new features (e.g., a cutting-edge travel time matrix
   computation algorithm) typically will live in urbanpy/utils to get
   some airtime before a decision is made regarding whether they are to
   be migrated to the core modules.
-  As every PR may require several CPU hours of CI testing, we
   discourage submitting PRs to fix one typo, one warning, etc. We
   recommend fixing the same issue at the file level at least (e.g.: fix
   all typos in a file, fix all compiler warning in a file, etc.)
